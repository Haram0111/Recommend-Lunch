                <p class="box__description">It is a Korean grilled dish made by grilling pork belly.
                    It is named because the flesh and fat parts are overlapped three times.
                    They grill it without seasoning, dip it in salt or ssamjang, and wrap it in vegetables.
                    In Korea, there is a theory that pork belly is helpful when you inhale a lot of dust into your lungs.
                    Therefore, miners have eaten a lot of pork belly since before, and in recent years, the consumption of pork belly has soared whenever yellow dust blows.
                    However, there is no sufficient medical basis for the theory that pork belly or pork oil prevents or treats a lung-related disease.</p>

                    similar to Neobiani without soup, and it is estimated that the soup would have changed to its own form by the end of Japanese 
                    colonial era. Since the 1960s, the perception that a dish named Bulgogi refers to a meat dish with soup has changed, but 
                    Gwangyang Bulgogi or Eonyang Bulgogi still maintains the same shape as Neobiani Grilled.</p>

                    chopped green onions, and onions in kimchi. Instead of pork, they sometimes boil it with cans of tuna. The history 
                    of kimchijjigae actually begins around the same time as kimchi. There is a theory that it is difficult to just eat 
                    it because it is too sour and salty, or that the way kimchi was boiled in water to soak up the amount has become 
                    the current kimchi stew. The most important thing is to use kimchi that is ripe enough to taste sour.</p>

                    as the main ingredient. It is a food boiled with soybean paste and meat, shellfish, tofu, zucchini, potatoes, and enoki mushrooms. 
                    There are cases where beef is added to meat, and there are cases where pork is added. The main ingredient is tofu, and the rest 
                    can be added according to your preference. The soup is thick and various ingredients are combined, so it tastes good even if 
                    you mix rice. It is also boiled spicy with red pepper paste.</p>

                    Usually, bean sprouts, carrots, zucchini, and mushrooms are on top. Also, meat, eggs, and sesame oil may be added depending on your preference.
                    In Joseon, which was a Confucian country, there is an aspect of applying the five colors caused by the five elements of yin 
                    and yang even when eating food. As a result, the basic table setting itself had to be diversified, and due to the 
                    nature of the agricultural society, it was difficult to bring the lunch table to the rice field, so there is a theory that 
                    the same form as bibimbap would have come out.</p>

                    Jeyukbokkeum on top. The original meaning of 'Jeoyuk' means pork. It is a relatively short-lived food that became popular 
                    only in the mid-1980s, starting with a restaurant without a signboard in Jung-gu, Seoul. Usually, it is often seen in places
                     with a large floating population, such as near universities, near companies, and driver's restaurants.</p>

                    This is because gimbap at that time was a special food to pack when going on a picnic rather than a daily meal. Gimbap 
                    wrapped in a lunch box outdoors was easy to spoil, so vinegar, which served as a preservative, was added. Throughout 
                    the 1980s, sesame seeds, salt, and sesame oil were added instead of vinegar and gradually replaced with mixed rice. </p>

                    meat, vegetables, and stir-fried rice cakes, but these days it is called "Gungjung Tteokbokki." </p>

                    in Joseon. Since it was a dish that served on the Surat table, various specialties were put in.</p>
